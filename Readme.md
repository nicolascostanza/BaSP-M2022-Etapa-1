### Week 2

◉I divided the page into 4 parts. Header, Main, Aside, Footer

◉Then I subdivided the main into sections using Divs

◉work on each one separately, adding your headers, texts, forms and photos

◉I got the HTML-code of some small icons such as the letter or house in the contact us section of the aside

◉And the other icons download them in png format

### Week 3

◉I divided the page into 4 parts. Header, Main, Aside, Footer

◉Gave styles to the headings and texts

◉Positioned the header, aside, main and footer and gave them their corresponding margins and paddings

◉Implement some classes for the details and style the form

◉Styled the photos

◉Organize element tags, classes and IDs in css

### Week 4

◉I made a diagram on paper and I was iterating on the division of smaller and smaller boxes thinking what flex properties would serve me in each case

◉Create necessary divs for the flexbox implementation and rearrange the html structure as desired

◉Apply flexbox using many borders to guide me

◉Once it was working fine i implemented the styling in px and introduced the media queries

◉then I put body with font-size of 16px for desktop and tables. And 13px for mobile. Change all measurements from PX to EM
